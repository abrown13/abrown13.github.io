Arthur James candle packaging keeps the candle in pristine condition while in the store, while also allowing customers to smell it. Candles are packaged in a box with holes on the top. The designs on the box allow customers to see what type of scent the candle will be before smelling it. There are also no stickers on the actual candle jar for easy reuse.
