### Education

Abigail Anne Brown (Abby) graduated from Eastern Washington University with a degree in Visual Communication Design. She received a minor in Business Administration and a certificate in User Experience Design. 

### Work

While in school, Abby worked at the Running Start office at Eastern for three and a half years. There were a lot of receptionist-type duties involved with this job, but she was also given the opportunity to do some design work there as well. She has created various flyers for events that Running Start holds and managed their Instagram account. 

### Internships

Abby has had the opportunity to intern at both 14Four in Spokane and Eastern Washington University Career Services. At 14Four, Abby was able to design websites and work with developers. At her internship with Career Services, Abby made flyers for events. She also created different versions of those flyers for print, monitors, and social media. Abby also had the opportunity to design and produce various buttons that Career Services hands out to students at their office and school events. 

### Future

Abby aspires to work in the Spokane area, creating fun, interesting and thoughtful designs. She would like to work on designing anything from flyers, to packaging design, to web or app design. She would love to see her designs being displayed, whether that’s in stores, online, on buttons or stickers, or hanging in business windows. When Abby isn’t designing, she enjoys learning about and experimenting with makeup, reading, kayaking, and most importantly, spending time with her family.
