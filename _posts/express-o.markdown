Do you want to try something new at your regular coffee stand but they don't list everything on the menu? Or do you feel pressured to order quickly because cars are lined up behind you so you just end up ordering the same old thing? Express-O allows you to see the full menu of coffee stands before you get to the window. You can save and customize drinks within the app. You are also able to find new stands around you with the map feature.
