Do you want to try something new at your regular coffee stand but they don't list everything on the menu? Or do you feel pressured to order quickly because cars are lined up behind you so you just end up ordering the same old thing? Express-O allows you to see the full menu of coffee stands before you get to the window. You can save and customize drinks within the app. You are also able to find new stands around you with the map feature.

### The Problem

**Coffee Stand Menus**

The menus posted outside of every coffee stand all show the same generic drinks: espresso, americano, mocha, etc. However, the majority of coffee stands have a lot more options, including specialty drinks, but they aren’t posted anywhere. Menus also don’t include all the different flavors that coffee stands have to offer, and often flavors differ between each stand.

**Timeliness**

Ordering a new drink at a coffee stand is difficult. Mostly because you often get a lineup of cars behind you and can feel pressure to order quickly, forcing you to order the same old drink you always get.

### The Solution

**Express-O**

Espress-O allows customer to look at ALL menu items, including specialty drinks and flavors before getting to the coffee stand window. Customers can add drinks to their favorites, allowing for quick ordering, avoiding a long lineup of cars.
