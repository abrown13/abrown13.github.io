**Creative Action Network's Mission:** Every great book deserves a great cover. Sadly, many of the greatest classics in the public domain are left with poorly designed or autogenerated covers that fail to capture what makes these books exciting and inspiring to us. We're asking illustrators, typographers, and designers of all stripes to create new covers for over 150 of the greatest works of fiction in the public domain including new 2019 titles! Together we can help to keep these classics fresh, modern, and accessible to new generations of readers.
