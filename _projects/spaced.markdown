SPACED is a new, conceptual company that takes the average person to space for an affordable price. Passengers will be taken to space and back, safely, in one day. Right now, SPACED is able to take passengers to the moon, Mars, Jupiter and Europa, but it will soon be expanding to more locations throughout space. Even though the price is low, SPACED provides passengers with the most luxurious of experiences.
