ICONIC is an alphabet book with unique shapes for each letter. Each letter stands for a popular fashion icon from the 1950’s. Each letter is also cut out from a fabric or pattern that correlates to each icon’s style in the 50’s in a shape that is specific to their style. The book also includes fun, fashion-related quotes from the fashion icons.
