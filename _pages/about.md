# Abby

Abigail Anne Brown, also known as Abby, is amidst her last quarter at Eastern Washington University pursuing a degree in Visual Communication Design. Along with that, she will also be receiving a minor in Business Administration and a certificate in User Experience Design. It took Abby a very long time to find her passion in life, but she finally found it in design and could not be more happy with it. Currently, Abby works at Eastern Washington University at the Running Start office as an office aide. There are a lot of receptionist-type duties involved with this job, including training new employees, but she has also been given the opportunity to do some design work there as well. She has created various flyers for events that Running Start holds and manages their Instagram account. She has also had the opportunity to intern at both 14Four in Spokane and Eastern Washington University Career Services. At 14Four, Abby was able to design websites and work with developers. At her internship with Career Services, Abby made flyers for events. She also created different versions of those flyers for print, monitors, and social media. Abby also had the opportunity to design and produce various buttons that Career Services hands out to students at their office and school events – ranging from cute to funny designs. Abby aspires to work in the Spokane area, creating fun, interesting, thoughtful, and simplistic designs. She would like to work on designing anything from flyers, to packaging design, to web or app design. She would love to see her designs being displayed whether that’s in stores, online, on buttons or stickers, or hanging in business windows. When Abby isn’t designing, she enjoys learning about and experimenting with makeup, reading, kayaking, and most importantly, spending time with her family.
